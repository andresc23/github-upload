This is a simple task list project that I did to better practice and familiarize myself with JavaScript.

In this project, I work with the DOM, and mostly utilize event listeners to add, delete, and filter through tasks, and output them onto the HTML page.

I also utilize the localStorage feature, so any tasks added will get saved to the local storage, so even if you exit or reload, you'll still see the same tasks that were left there.

Likewise, if you delete a task or clear all, they won't be seen next time you reload the page.

FontAwesome was the CSS used to make the output.

So far have moved on from the project, but will try to go back and fix some bugs/issues, such as the delete button not displaying properly, and adding empty and same tasks, as well as adding more functionality.
